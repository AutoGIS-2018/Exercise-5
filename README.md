# Exercise-5

This week we will practice how to create 1) static and 2) interactive maps in Python. In this exercise, there is no ready-made Notebook-file to start with. All instructions are given in this readme.md -file and you should create all necessary files for completing the exercise (notebook-file or a python script file, and the output maps in .png and .html format). For this exercise a folder called **docs** has been created for storing and publishing the outputs.  

For both maps, think a bit about the audience of the map, and pay attention to your cartographic choises. You can read a few useful hints about [what to consider when creating maps from this post](https://www.gislounge.com/ten-things-to-consider-when-making-a-map/). 

- Exercise 5 is due by the end of day on Wednesday the 5th of December.

- Scores on this exercise are out of 20 points. 

## Problem 0: Feedback for the first half of the course in Period II

Having completed the first half of the AutoGIS course, we would again ask you to complete [this mid-term feedback form](https://elomake.helsinki.fi/lomakkeet/84893/lomake.html) to help us
to continue developing and improving the course.



## Problem 1: Visualize a static map with multiple layers on it (8 points)

- Your task is to create a nice static map using the skills you leared in lesson 5. **Create as interesting, good and beautiful STATIC map(s) as you can**.
- **Use your imagination**, you can e.g. do some calculations based on the datasets used during this course (travel time data, population data, address points..) or use the analyses that we have done earlier in the course. 
- Remember to commit the code you used for generating the plots inside this exercise-5 repository. (also provide the data, or at least a link to the input data used)
- Save your map(s) as png image, and store the output file(s) in the **docs** folder (You will need the png files in problem 3!)
  

## Problem 2: Visualize an interactive map (10 points)

- Your task is to create a nice INTERACTIVE map using the skills you leared in lesson 5. **Create as interesting, good and beautiful INTERACTIVE map(s) as you can** using either Folium or mplleaflet. 
- **Use your imagination**, you can e.g. do some calculations based on the datasets used during this course (travel time data, population data, address points..) or use the analyses that we have done earlier in the course. 
- Think about including interactive elements, such as popup text in the map.
- Remember to commit the code you used for generating the plots inside this exercise-5 repository. (also provide the data, or at least a link to the input data used)
- Store the interactive map(s) in .html format in the **docs** folder. (You will need them in problem 3!)


## Problem 3: Publish your maps online (2 points)

 You should now have **ALL** your maps stored in the **docs** folder inside this repository
- Add links to those maps in the specific Entrance page (index.md) that you can find in the **docs** folder. 
- There are more instructions how the links should be formatted in the [**docs/index.md -file**](docs/index.md). 
. You can find more detailed instructions for storing the maps on course webpages [here](https://automating-gis-processes.github.io/2018/lessons/L5/share-on-github.html#sharing-interactive-plots-on-github).
